# Sprite Composition

Discipline around draw order, naming, and grouping. Prevents the "my highlight disappeared behind the ball" and "I can't find the shape to edit" problems at scale.

## Z-Order Is Draw Order

The tool assigns z-index in the order shapes are created. Later shapes render **on top**. There is no late-stage z reordering by name — order-of-creation is load-bearing.

### Canonical bottom-up order

1. **Ground shadow** — furthest back (ellipse on ground, under the object)
2. **Background fills** — large base shapes
3. **Primary form** — the main shape (ball, body, etc.)
4. **Form-shadow tier** — dark-mid band on the unlit side
5. **Core shadow** — narrow darkest band
6. **Rim / reflected light** — edge highlights on shadow side
7. **Main highlight** — lit-side cluster
8. **Specular peak** — brightest hotspot
9. **Line details** — eyes, outlines, drawn last so nothing covers them

If you discover something drawn too low in z, you have two options:
- **Redo the cell** — `clear --cell` then rebuild. Cleanest for fresh work.
- **Delete + redraw the over-covering shape** — deletes the top shape and re-adds it; new z puts it on top.

`set-z` exists but is brittle — prefer draw-order discipline.

## Naming Convention

Every shape that might be referenced later should have `--name`. Points that are just decoration can skip naming.

### Recommended structure

| Shape role | Name pattern |
|---|---|
| Ground shadow | `shadow` |
| Primary form | `ball`, `body`, `head` |
| Lighting tiers (auto-named by tool) | `<target>_hl_<i>`, `<target>_sh_<i>`, or `<custom>_<i>` via `--name` |
| Custom lighting (mid/rim/spec) | `mid`, `rim`, `spec` (passed via `--name`) |
| Eyes, mouth, etc. | `eye_l`, `eye_r`, `mouth` |

Names must be **unique within a cell**. Reusing a name across cells is fine — that's how `clone` and per-frame edits work.

**Don't** use generic names like `shape1`, `point3`. Future-you searching `shapes --cell` will hate past-you.

## Shape Groups — Batch Edits Within a Cell

Shape groups bundle named shapes so `move-group` / `recolor-group` operate on all at once:

```
sprite.js shape-group create face eye_l eye_r mouth --cell 0,0
sprite.js move-group face --cell 0,0 --dx 0 --dy -1
sprite.js recolor-group face --cell 0,0 --color "#ff004d"
```

Use `--all-cells true` to apply across every cell containing a shape group of that name — useful for moving a character's face across all animation frames in one command.

### When to create shape groups

- **Multi-part subjects** — face features that should animate together.
- **Tiered lighting** — group `ball`, `mid`, `rim`, `spec`, all `ball_hl_*`/`ball_sh_*` as `ball_all` for easy relocation.
- **Avoid** for single-shape "groups" — just use the name directly.

## Cell Groups — Animation Sequences

Cell groups establish playback order:

```
sprite.js group create bounce 0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7
sprite.js view-anim bounce --fps 10 --loops 3
```

Cells can belong to multiple groups (e.g., a 12-frame walk could have `walk` covering 0..11 and `walk_down_cycle` covering 0..3).

## Sheet Grid Layout

When creating a project, choose grid dimensions purposefully:

| Layout | `--rows × --cols` | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Single row | `1 × N` | Simple cycles (bounce, idle) — scrubbable |
| Square | `4 × 4`, `8 × 8` | Character with multiple animations (idle row, walk row, attack row) |
| Wide grid | `2 × 8`, `3 × 8` | Character sheet — row per animation type |
| Tall | `8 × 1` | Vertical scroll / spritesheet tools that want column layout |

**Don't** put unrelated sprites in the same project — each conceptual asset gets its own sprite sheet (own `sprite.js new`). Cross-asset pollution makes export paths and palettes messy.

## Clipping Shapes to Other Shapes

When you need a shape — a curve, a pattern, a decoration — to appear **only within** the silhouette of another shape, use `--clip-to <mask_shape>` on the draw command. Pixels outside the mask are dropped.

Typical uses:
- Surface detail on a curved form (seams, stitching, stripes on a body).
- Decorations (spots, decals, logos) that should follow a character's silhouette.
- Construction curves where only the visible-on-surface portion should persist — often the drawn shape is drafted much larger than the mask, with only the intersection surviving.

Pattern:
1. Draw the base shape with a name (`--name body`).
2. Draw the decoration *over* it with `--clip-to body`. The decoration may extend well beyond the body's bounds — clipping discards the overflow.

```
sprite.js draw circle  --cell 0,0 --cx 32 --cy 32 --r 20 --color "#df7126" --name body
sprite.js draw ellipse --cell 0,0 --cx 10 --cy 32 --rx 24 --ry 24 \
                       --color "#000000" --filled false \
                       --name stripe --clip-to body
```

The ellipse's outline would normally extend from x=−14 to x=34, but only the pixels falling inside `body` become permanent points. Result: a curved stripe that hugs the body's surface and disappears at its edges.

Limitations: the clip source must be an unfilled outline (`--filled false` on ellipse or circle). Masks can be circle, ellipse, or rect.

## Copy / Clone Patterns

- **`copy --from --to`** — deep-copies *all shapes* in a cell. Use when building animation frames from a base frame.
- **`clone-cell --from R,C --to R1,C1 R2,C2 ...`** — atomic fan-out: copy one source cell into many destinations in a single call. Replaces the bash loop pattern for initializing a full animation strip from a base frame. Either all destinations succeed or nothing changes.
- **`clone <name> --from --to [--as]`** — copies a *single named shape* across cells. Use when only one element moves across frames (e.g., eye blink — clone `eye_l` from "open" frame to "closed" frame, adjust).

Rule of thumb: `clone-cell` first (seed every frame from the base), then `move-to` / `resize` per-frame. Only `clone` for single-shape changes on an otherwise-unchanged scene.

## Pattern-Matched Shape Groups Across Cells

Creating a shape group across every cell that contains matching shapes:

```
sprite.js shape-group create seams --all-cells --pattern '^seam_'
```

This scans every cell, finds shapes whose names match the regex, and creates (or overwrites) a `seams` shape group per cell. Replaces the `shapes --cell | grep -oE 'seam_*' | sort -u` bash pattern used for refresh/delete workflows.

## Batch Mode for Per-Frame Work

For per-frame parameterized work (8 animation frames with different ball positions), use `batch` with `--vars-file`:

```
sprite.js batch --file frame-ops.json --vars-file frames.json
```

`frame-ops.json` contains placeholders like `"cx": "{{cx}}"`, and `frames.json` is an array of dicts — one per frame — that get substituted in. Fail-fast by default; pass `--continue-on-error` only when best-effort is what you want. See `sprite-editing/references/tool-reference.md` for DSL details.

## Common Mistakes

- **Highlights drawn before the ball** — they render underneath and disappear. Always draw lighting *after* the target shape.
- **Ground shadow drawn last** — ends up on top of the ball. Draw it first.
- **Un-named shapes you need to edit** — inspect with `shapes --cell`, rename via `rename`, but far easier to name up front.
- **Per-frame rebuilding instead of copy+adjust** — drawing all 8 frames from scratch is 8× the work and produces inconsistencies.
- **Line details (eyes, outlines) drawn before lighting** — lighting then covers them. Details always last.
