# Game Integration

Patterns for taking claude-sprites exports into a real game project. Everything here shipped in production games (horde-peril, thrill-peril) — prefer these shapes over inventing new ones.

## Export layout convention

One sheet per character family / tileset / UI set, exported into the game repo:

```
<game-repo>/
  asset-src/gen-build.mjs        # generator script (source of truth)
  asset-src/build.json           # emitted ops — reviewable, replayable
  assets/claude-sprites/<name>/  # one folder per sheet
    <name>.png
    <name>.atlas.json
```

Export each sheet with `sprite.js export --dest <game-repo>/assets/claude-sprites/<name>`.

## Full-game asset builds: generate, don't hand-write

A game's asset set is hundreds of ops (thrill-peril: ~760 across 9 sheets). Hand-writing that JSON doesn't scale. The blessed pattern:

1. Write `asset-src/gen-build.mjs` — a small JS script with helper functions (`draw()`, per-archetype recipes) that emits `build.json`
2. Run `node asset-src/gen-build.mjs > asset-src/build.json`
3. Replay with `sprite.js batch asset-src/build.json`
4. Export each sheet

The generator is the maintainable artifact; the emitted `build.json` is the reviewable one. Rebuilding a sheet after a tweak is a re-run, not an archaeology dig.

**Variant tiers via recolor, not redraw.** For enemy tiers / palette swaps (5 zombie tiers from one drawn set): draw the base variant, `clone-cell` its frames, put the recolorable shapes in a pattern shape-group, then `recolor-group` per tier. One drawn set, N variants — see the palette-swap recipe in `recipes/`.

## Phaser (proven wiring)

Animated sheets load as Aseprite; every cell group becomes a named animation with correct per-frame durations:

```js
// preload — animated sheets (characters, fx)
for (const k of ['dancer', 'zombie', 'gfx']) {
  this.load.aseprite(k, `assets/claude-sprites/${k}/${k}.png`,
                        `assets/claude-sprites/${k}/${k}.atlas.json`);
}
// static sheets (tiles, ui, props) — plain atlas, frames by name
this.load.atlas('gtiles', 'assets/claude-sprites/gtiles/gtiles.png',
                          'assets/claude-sprites/gtiles/gtiles.atlas.json');

// create — one call registers all frameTags as animations
for (const k of ['dancer', 'zombie', 'gfx']) this.anims.createFromAseprite(k);

// use
sprite.play({ key: 'walkd', repeat: -1 });   // 'walkd' = cell group name
img.setFrame('tomb');                          // named cell = named frame
```

Two gotchas:

- **Phaser ignores the pivot slice** — call `sprite.setOrigin(0.5, 1)` in code for bottom-center characters. Unity/Godot importers do read the exported pivot.
- Frames carry both numeric indices and name aliases, so named-cell lookups (`setFrame('tomb')`) and tag playback both work from the same atlas.

Unity/Godot: import `<name>.atlas.json` with their Aseprite JSON importers — frameTags, durations, and pivot come through without game code.

## App icons from sprites

Draw the icon as a normal cell (32×32 works well), then export crisp nearest-neighbor upscales straight from the CLI — never let an image editor resample pixel art:

```
sprite.js view --cell 0,0 --scale 1  --out icon-32.png     # favicon
sprite.js view --cell 0,0 --scale 6  --out icon-192.png    # 32 × 6
sprite.js view --cell 0,0 --scale 16 --out icon-512.png    # 32 × 16
```

Reference the PNGs from the web manifest (192 + 512, `"purpose": "any maskable"` — keep important detail inside the inner ~80% for maskable) and `<link rel="icon">`. Proven on two shipped PWAs.

## Verify before wiring

Before any sheet reaches game code, run the `sprite-verification` skill: per-
frame contact-sheet inspection, baseline alignment, and an in-engine loader
check. Frame counts and registered animations are not verification.

## QA loop

Judge art at scale before shipping it into the game:

```
sprite.js view --sheet --scale 8 --out qa.png    # then read qa.png back
```

Review the rendered PNG after every few draw operations, not just at the end — composition mistakes compound across cloned frames.

## Port hygiene

The sprite server defaults to port 3377. When a game dev server (or a second sprite project) is running, set `SPRITE_PORT` to keep sessions isolated — every CLI call and the web UI follow it.
